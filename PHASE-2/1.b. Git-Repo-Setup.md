### Steps to Create a Private Git Repository, Generate a Personal Access Token, Connect to the Repository, and Push Code to It

#### 1. Create a Private Git Repository

1. **Go to your preferred Git hosting platform:**
   - GitHub: [https://github.com](https://github.com)
   - GitLab: [https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com)
   - Bitbucket: [https://bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org)

2. **Log in to your account or sign up if you don't have one.**

3. **Create a new repository:**
   - Click on the "+" icon or "New repository" button.
   - Name the repository "Boardgame".
   - Set it as **Private**.
   - Click on **Create repository**.

4. **Copy the HTTPS link of the new repository:**
   - The link will look something like `https://github.com/FahadMKhan/Boardgame.git`.

#### 2. Download the Existing Repository

1. **Download the repository from GitHub:**
   - Visit `https://github.com/FahadMKhan/Boardgame-sourcecode`.
   - Click on the **Code** button and download the ZIP file.

2. **Extract the downloaded ZIP file.**

3. **Open Git Bash in the extracted directory:**
   - Go into the extracted repository directory.
   - Press `Shift` + `right-click` and select **Open Git Bash here**.

#### 3. Clone the New Private Repository

1. **Clone the new private repository locally:**
   - In the Git Bash terminal, type the following command:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/FahadMKhan/Boardgame.git
     ```

2. **A pop-up will appear asking you to sign in with a few options.**
   - Click on **Token**.

#### 4. Generate a Personal Access Token

1. **Go to your GitHub profile:**
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right corner.
   - Select **Settings**.

2. **Navigate to Developer Settings:**
   - Scroll down to **Developer settings**.

3. **Create a Personal Access Token:**
   - Click on **Personal access tokens**.
   - Select **Tokens (classic)**.
   - Click on **Generate new token** and choose **Generate new token (classic)**.

4. **Configure the token:**
   - Name your token, e.g., `boardgame-git-token`.
   - Select the level of access you want to give to the token. Typically, select all permissions except `delete:packages` and `delete:repo`.
   - Click on **Generate token**.

5. **Copy the token:**
   - Make sure you copy the token and store it somewhere safe because you wonâ€™t be able to see it again.

6. **Paste the token:**
   - When prompted by Git Bash, paste the token into the GitHub sign-in token box and click on **Sign in**.

#### 5. Copy Files to the New Repository

1. **Change directory to the new `Boardgame` repository:**
   ```sh
   cd Boardgame
   ```

2. **Copy all documents from the downloaded `BoardgameListingWebApp-master` directory to the `Boardgame` directory.**

3. **Add the files to the staging area:**
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit the changes:**
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

5. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**
   ```sh
   git push
   ```

#### 6. Verify the Changes on GitHub

1. **Go to your GitHub account.**
2. **Navigate to the `Boardgame` repository.**
3. **Verify that all the files have been pushed successfully.**

By following these steps, you have created a private Git repository, generated a personal access token, connected to the repository, and pushed your code to it.

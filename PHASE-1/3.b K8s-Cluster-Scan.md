# User Guide for Scanning Kubernetes Cluster with Kubeaudit

## Introduction
Once your Kubernetes Cluster is created, it's essential to scan it for any issues. Various tools like **Kube-hunter**, **Kube-score**, and **Polaris** are available, but they may not always work as expected. Therefore, we will use **Kubeaudit**.

## Downloading Kubeaudit

1. **Access the Kubeaudit Release Page:**
   Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit/releases
   ```

2. **Choose the Appropriate Release:**
   Select the release that matches your VM. For example:
   ```
   https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit/releases/download/v0.22.1/kubeaudit_0.22.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   ```

## Installing Kubeaudit on the Master Node

1. **Download Kubeaudit:**
   On the master node, execute:
   ```
   wget https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit/releases/download/v0.22.1/kubeaudit_0.22.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   ```
   *This command downloads the Kubeaudit tarball.*

2. **Extract the Tarball:**
   ```
   tar -xvzf kubeaudit_0.22.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   ```
   *This extracts the Kubeaudit executable from the tarball.*

3. **Move the Executable to a System Directory:**
   ```
   sudo mv kubeaudit /usr/local/bin/
   ```
   *This moves the Kubeaudit executable to a directory included in the system PATH, making it accessible from anywhere.*

## Scanning the Kubernetes Cluster

1. **Run Kubeaudit:**
   ```
   kubeaudit all
   ```
   *This command scans the entire Kubernetes cluster for any security issues or misconfigurations.*

By following these steps, you can effectively scan your Kubernetes cluster using Kubeaudit to identify and address potential security issues.

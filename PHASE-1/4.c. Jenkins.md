### User Guide for Setting Up Jenkins

This guide will help you install Jenkins and Docker on your VM and set up the Jenkins server.

#### Step 1: Install Java on Jenkins VM

**Check Java Installation**

1. Open your terminal and type:
   ```sh
   java
   ```
2. If Java is not installed, you will see a command to install OpenJDK 17. Copy that command but do not run it yet. We will include it in our installation script.

#### Step 2: Create Jenkins Installation Script

**Go to Jenkins Installation Documentation**

1. Visit [Jenkins Linux Installation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/).
2. Under the "Long Term Support release" section, you will find the installation commands.

**Create a Shell Script for Jenkins Installation**

1. Log in to your Jenkins VM via SSH:
   ```sh
   ssh ubuntu@your_Jenkins_vm_ip
   ```
2. Create a shell script file for Jenkins installation:
   ```sh
   vi install_jenkins.sh
   ```

3. **Copy the following script and paste it into the `install_jenkins.sh` file:**

   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash

   # Install OpenJDK 17 JRE Headless
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y

   # Download Jenkins GPG key
   sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
     https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

   # Add Jenkins repository to package manager sources
   echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
     https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
     /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

   # Update package manager repositories
   sudo apt-get update

   # Install Jenkins
   sudo apt-get install jenkins -y
   ```

4. Save the file and exit the text editor by pressing `Esc`, typing `:wq`, and hitting `Enter`.

**Make the Script Executable**

1. Give execute permission to the script:
   ```sh
   sudo chmod +x install_jenkins.sh
   ```

**Run the Jenkins Installation Script**

1. Execute the script to install Jenkins:
   ```sh
   ./install_jenkins.sh
   ```

This script will automate the installation process of OpenJDK 17 JRE Headless and Jenkins.

### Step 3: Install Docker on Jenkins VM

**Create a Shell Script for Docker Installation**

1. Create a shell script file for Docker installation:
   ```sh
   vi docker.sh
   ```

2. **Copy the following script and paste it into the `docker.sh` file:**

   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash

   # Update package manager repositories
   sudo apt-get update

   # Install necessary dependencies
   sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl

   # Create directory for Docker GPG key
   sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

   # Download Docker's GPG key
   sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

   # Ensure proper permissions for the key
   sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

   # Add Docker repository to Apt sources
   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
   sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

   # Update package manager repositories
   sudo apt-get update

   sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor by pressing `Esc`, typing `:wq`, and hitting `Enter`.

**Make the Script Executable**

1. Give execute permission to the script:
   ```sh
   sudo chmod +x docker.sh
   ```

**Run the Docker Installation Script**

1. Execute the script to install Docker:
   ```sh
   ./docker.sh
   ```

**Allow Non-Root Users to Execute Docker Commands**

1. By default, only the root user can execute Docker commands. Allow all users to execute Docker commands by changing the permissions:
   ```sh
   sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
   ```

### Step 4: Access Jenkins

**Get the Public IP Address of Your Jenkins VM**

1. Open your web browser and enter the IP address followed by the port number. Jenkins runs on port 8080 by default. For example, if your public IP address is `10.101.10.101`, you would enter:
   ```
   http://10.101.10.101:8080
   ```

**Unlock Jenkins**

1. You will see the following message:
   ```
   Unlock Jenkins
   To ensure Jenkins is securely set up by the administrator, a password has been written to the log (not sure where to find it?) and this file on the server:
   /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   Please copy the password from either location and paste it below.
   ```

2. Go to your terminal and enter the following command to get your password:
   ```sh
   sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```

3. Copy the password and paste it into the Administrator password box.

4. Click **Continue**.

**Install Suggested Plugins**

1. On the next page, click on **Install suggested plugins**.

**Create First Admin User**

1. Once the installation is completed, enter the following details:
   - Username
   - Password
   - Confirm password
   - Full name
   - E-mail address

2. Click **Save and Continue**.

**Instance Configuration**

1. On the next page, you will see the URL to access your Jenkins:
   ```
   Instance Configuration
   Jenkins URL: http://10.101.10.101:8080/
   ```

2. Your Jenkins is now ready to use.

### Conclusion

By following this guide, you have installed Docker and Jenkins on your VM and set up the Jenkins server. You can now start using Jenkins to automate your build and deployment processes.
